    Growing up I always found myself lost in thought wondering how far humanity could go if they just had proper 
    tools that could help them continuously develop and adjust to the unfairness of the universe. I then made it my 
    mission in life to seek the limits of technology. In order to reach such a goal, I dedicated countless hours 
    towards creating this company, I found others like me who are willing to work towards the same goal.
    We as a whole, made it our mission to continuously develop new hardware and software that could 
    assist others in their day to day life. As technology becomes widely accessible, our hardware will continue to 
    be supplied.
