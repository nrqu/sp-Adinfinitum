                                Growing up I always found myself lost in thought wondering how far humanity could go if
                                they just had proper
                                tools that could help them continuously develop and adjust to the unfairness of the
                                universe. I then made it my
                                mission in life to seek the limits of technology. In order to reach such a goal, I
                                dedicated countless hours
                                towards creating this company, I found others like me who are willing to work towards
                                the same goal.
                                We as a whole, made it our mission to continuously develop new hardware and software
                                that could
                                assist others in their day to day life. As technology becomes widely accessible, our
                                hardware will continue to
                                be supplied.
